All scanned maps are authentic and originally collected by the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies. Melville J. Herskovits established Northwestern University's Program of African Studies in 1948 (the first of its kind at a major research university in the United States). The Herskovits Library, formally created as a separate library in 1954, has since its inception collected maps that describe Africa from their earliest appearance to the most current. Map area coverage includes the continent, regions (particularly North Africa and Algeria), islands (particularly Madagascar), and a few city plans. All of these maps are loose items, though many have been excised from published atlases. Some of the highlights of the digital collection are: a series of Ptolemic maps of North Africa by Ruscelli, ca. 1565; Forlani: Africa , 1562; Mercator: Africa, 1595; Blaeu: Ã†thiopia ca. 1650 (a Prester John map); Carey: Africa, 1795 (first map of Africa published in the United States), Arrowsmith: Africa, 1802 (notable for its large dimensions, 124 x 145 cm.), a series of Algerian maps published by the French government in the mid-1800's, and maps by other notable cartographers, such as Hondius, Jansson, de Jode, de L'Isle, Ortelius, Sanson, and de Wit. The original maps are kept and maintained in the map collection in the Government \u0026 Geographic Information Collection. We welcome questions, comments, and suggestions concerning any aspect of this digital collection, particularly with regards to provenance. Other antique maps from the Herskovits Library which were not included in this digital collection are either duplicate copies or other editions, such as French government sets covering Algeria."]}}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","type":"Canvas","height":10082,"width":12330,"label":{"none":["inu-dil-a629a291-a658-43b9-8734-f0a3e1a682cf.tif"]},"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3/full/!300,300/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","height":300,"width":300,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation/0","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","body":{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3/full/600,/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/tiff","height":10082,"width":12330,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}}]}],"placeholderCanvas":{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/placeholder","type":"Canvas","width":640,"height":523,"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/placeholder/annotation-page/0","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/placeholder/annotation/0","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3/full/!640,523/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/tiff","width":640,"height":523,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/65cc746d-2201-4d71-99da-83fa2e357ea3","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/f6055e36-9fe0-4a78-a3bd-24644619616e?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/placeholder"}]}]}}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://vlsrobinson.github.io/vr-test-canopy/api/facet/author/undefined.json?sort=random","https://vlsrobinson.github.io/vr-test-canopy/api/facet/place-of-publication/undefined.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"A new and accurate map of Nubia \u0026 Abissinia, : together with all the kingdoms tributary thereto, and bordering upon them - Untitled","description":"Laid down from the latest \u0026 best authorities and regulated by astron.l observations by Eman.l Bowen ; Scale 1:9,400,000. ; Prime meridian: London ; Numbered \"No. 52.\" ; Decorative title cartouche with trees ; Shows boundaries, rivers, forests and principal settlements, with tents showing areas inhabited by nomads ; Relief shown pictorially ; Covers area of northeast Africa between the River Nile and the Red Sea; equivalent to modern Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia ; London : E.
